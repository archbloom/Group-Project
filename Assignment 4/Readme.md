###Simple Version Control System.

######Problem Statement: Create a simple version control (svc) program called "svc".

######Steps to run the code:
	* run the shell script in root
		* # bash command_maker.sh svc.cpp svc

		* Why root?
			- To copy the executable to /usr/bin/ you need the permissions hence.

	* this will create the command to run the svc.cpp code

	* now to run the svc.cpp
		* commit
			- svc filename.txt (in our case file name is "test.txt")
		* to display the version
			- svc N (where N is the version number)

	* output is in 'output.txt' file
